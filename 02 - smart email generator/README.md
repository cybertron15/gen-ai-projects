# Smart Email Generator (Concept)

Smart Email Generator is a simple concept project that demonstrates how AI can be used to create different styles of emails. It uses few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought techniques to guide the writing process, making the generated emails more natural, relevant, and useful.

The system is designed to generate professional, casual, or persuasive emails based on a small set of examples and style guidelines. However, it is not limited to just these styles. You can extend it easily by providing new examples and new styles, which means the possibilities are endless.

## How it works

You start by defining a style for the email, like professional or casual, and provide a few examples that fit that style. When you input a description of the email you want to generate, the system uses the examples and thought process to produce a complete email in the selected style.

## Techniques used

Few-shot prompting is used to show the AI what a good email looks like without needing thousands of samples.

Chain-of-thought prompting is used to help the AI reason more clearly about the structure, tone, and intent of the email before writing it.

## Important note

This is just a concept project meant to give you a strong starting point. You are encouraged to improve it further, add more intelligent style handling, better validation, and deeper personalization according to your needs.
